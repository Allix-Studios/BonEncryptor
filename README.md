# BonEncryptor
## About
This is a simple GUI encryption programm, running on on python with the pyCryptodom and tkinter libary, which uses AES to encrypt and Decrypt files
## How to start it
In the folder precompiled are an Linux 64x bit portable version and a 64bit windows installer and portable file. If you want to use the python file on itself you need to make sure you have installed tkinter, python3 and pyCryptodom on your system. To install pyCryptodom you can simply type, if pip is installed, `pip install pycrytodome` or on some Linux systems `python3-pip install pycrytodome`
## Why you shouldn`t use this project
- There are many better alternatives but they are not as simple
- Unfortunately this project is only avalible in the german language and will not be updated to english in the next time, because I dont have a windows system at the moment to compile the new python file.
## Why you should use it
- It`s very simple
- If you only speak german you could use it (but probably you couldn`t read this text)
- If you would use the Python file directly, you would get an english version because onlay the compiled versions are german
